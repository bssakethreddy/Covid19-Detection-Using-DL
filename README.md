# COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project leverages Deep Learning techniques to detect COVID-19 from CT scan images. It utilizes the **DeepLabV3** model for image segmentation and classification, achieving an accuracy of **98%**.

## Features
- Utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction.
- Implements **DeepLabV3** for segmentation and classification.
- Processes **CT scan images** for COVID-19 detection.
- Achieves high accuracy with optimized hyperparameters.
- Built using **Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV**.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook deeplabv3.ipynb
```

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of CT scan images and masks labeled for COVID-19 detection.


## Results
- Achieved an **accuracy of 98%** in COVID-19 detection.
- The model effectively segments affected lung areas.
